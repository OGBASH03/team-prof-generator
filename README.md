## Title
Team Profile Generator

## Description
This command-line application is designed to help you generate a professional and nicely formatted team roster in HTML based on user input. Once you have entered your team members and their information, the application will generate an HTML file displaying all team members in a table format. The application also allows you to click on team member email addresses, which will open your default email program and populate the TO field with the address. Additionally, you can click on a team member's GitHub username to open their GitHub profile in a new tab.

To get started, simply run the application and you will be prompted to enter the team manager's name, employee ID, email address, and office number. Once you have entered this information, you will be presented with a menu where you can choose to add an engineer or an intern, or finish building your team. If you choose to add an engineer or an intern, you will be prompted to enter their name, ID, email, and either their GitHub username or school depending on which option you choose. Once you have finished building your team, exit the application and the HTML file will be generated.

## Usage
To use this command-line application, start by running the program and entering your team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number. From there, you will be presented with a menu that allows you to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building your team. Selecting the engineer option will prompt you to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and selecting the intern option will prompt you to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school. Once you have finished building your team, exit the application, and an HTML file will be generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information you provided. The generated HTML file also allows you to click on an email address to open your default email program with the address populated in the TO field, and click on a GitHub username to open that user's profile in a new tab.
